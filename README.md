# ansible-facts-sample

This project is an example of how to use ansible facts to make decisions in playbooks. The playbook in playbook.yml installs apache on both Debian- and CentOS-based hosts, using ansible facts to determine which packages to install.

You can find the video tutorial that goes along with this sample code [here](https://youtu.be/HeZzfQOpNb4), and the accompanying presentation [here](https://gitpitch.com/whboyd/ansible-facts-sample).
